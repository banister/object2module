Object2module

* converts a Class (or the Singleton of an Object) to a Module
* also converts superclasses of the Class to iclasses, so the entire inheritance chain of the Class
* is 'modulified' and ready for inclusion/extension

How it works:
* First creates an IClass for the Class in question and sets the T_MODULE flag for the IClass
* Recursively coverts superclasses of the Class to IClasses creating a modulified version of the Class's inheritance chain
